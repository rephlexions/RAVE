# RAVE
Rave (Resource Annotator, Visualizer and Enhancer) is a complex environment in which to access and mix data from different services.

## Visualizer

The basic project is the Visualizer, which allows you to view in an interesting way data retrieved from two simple APIs, Wikipedia
and Crossref, to create flexible and comprehensible representations of complex phenomena.

## Annotator

The standard project is the Annotator, which allows you to add comments and annotations created by the application and the user to these views.

## Enhancer

The advanced project is the Enhancer, which integrates multiple external sources and creates complex visualizations, intelligently mixing information that is coherent with each other.
